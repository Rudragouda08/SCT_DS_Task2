Titanic Dataset – Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

 Project Overview:
This project performs data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
The goal is to understand the dataset, handle missing values, explore relationships between variables, and identify patterns that influenced passenger survival.

 Dataset:
Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset
File used: train.csv

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
The following analyses were performed:
Survival count distribution
Survival rate by gender
Survival rate by passenger class (Pclass)
Age distribution of passengers
Relationship between Fare and Survival
Survival rate by Embarkation port
Correlation analysis of numerical features

 Key Insights:
Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males
First-class passengers were more likely to survive
Higher ticket fares were associated with higher survival rates
Younger passengers, especially children, had better survival chances

Tools & Technologies:
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Google Colab
